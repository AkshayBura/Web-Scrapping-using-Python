I have scrapped the details in this Project using BeautifulSoup module and created a gui using Tkinter since I was new to django. 
First of all I have researched on how we can retrieve details from an E-Shopping Websites; from here I got to know regarding Beautiful Soup Module which will retrieve the details based on the tags of the E-Shopping Website. I had Retrieved the details of the product (Mobile) from the Amazon and Flipkart websites; Since both of them have different tags I have created two seperate Input boxes where user will be inserting URL's and the compare button will print the details in cmd/terminal. The Output will be prompted when we run Scrapping Website.py

I had retrieved/scrapped below mentioned details from Amazon and Flipkart.
1. Title
2. Price
3. Rating
4. Reviews & Ratings Count
5. Avalability
